//! Shared Rastered data types for the `prompt-prepare` stage.
//!
//! Everything that crosses a tile boundary or is reached by `select!` lives
//! here, in the `no_std` library, so host and RISC0 guest see the same
//! definitions.
//!
//! Two vocabulary rules shape every type below:
//!
//! - collections are `List<T>` (never `Vec<T>`): `Selectable`, referenced,
//!   iterated by `call_recur!` — never materialized whole;
//! - a type a tile takes or returns must be `Materializable`, which the
//!   `Selectable` derive grants only to structs with no `List` field. That is
//!   why the "work" types here ([`MergeStep`], [`MergeMatch`], [`VocabQuery`],
//!   [`VocabMatch`], [`MergeCursor`]) are small and scalar, while the
//!   collection-bearing types ([`PromptTokenizer`], [`BpePieces`],
//!   [`MergedPieces`], [`PromptTokenization`]) are only ever selected into,
//!   iterated, or grown through a draft.
